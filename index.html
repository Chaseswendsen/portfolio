     Hello reader, my name is Chase! I'm currently going to a coding camp called "Epicodus" while living in Independence Oregon! I figured what better time to do school remotely than now, its never been more convenient and such a safe option.  Currently I am working with the programs HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Although I am nervous I look forward to the opportunities I have at Epicodus to become a modern day coder! Before going to school I worked as a host at a diner, a woodworker at a cabinet shop, and a kids youth leader! I was born in Salem and moved to Silverton from 2nd grade all the way through highschool. I can't wait to see which career path is next for me!
